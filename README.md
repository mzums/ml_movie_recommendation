![alt text](image.png)

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. It leverages user and movie interaction data to predict user preferences and recommend movies they are likely to enjoy. 🍿

## 🔧 Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes a latent factor model to predict user ratings for movies. 🔢
- **Data Handling**: Processes and cleans user-movie rating datasets for model training. 🔄
- **Model Training**: Employs matrix factorization to learn embeddings for users and movies. 🌐
- **Recommendations**: Provides movie recommendations based on learned user preferences. 🎥

## 📚 Dataset

The system uses a publicly available movie ratings dataset (e.g., [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)). The dataset includes:

- `userId`: Unique identifier for users 🔑
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for movies 🎥
- `rating`: User's rating of a movie (e.g., on a scale of 1-5) 🌟
- `timestamp`: When the rating was made (optional) ⏰
